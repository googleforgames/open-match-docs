Open Match is instrumented with [OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/),
a telemetry library. The metrics that Open Match provides give you
insight into the performance and health of your Open Match cluster. Currently, Open Match supports the following telemetry backends:

* Prometheus
* Grafana
* Jaeger
* Stackdriver

## Install telemetry backend

 At this point we provides two ways to install supported telemetry backend, either via K8S yaml files or via helm.s

- Install via K8S yaml
  
    ```yaml
    # Install Prometheus
    kubectl apply -n open-match -f https://open-match.dev/install/v{{< param release_version >}}/yaml/03-prometheus-chart.yaml
    # Install Grafana
    kubectl apply -n open-match -f https://open-match.dev/install/v{{< param release_version >}}/yaml/04-grafana-chart.yaml
    # Install Jaeger
    kubectl apply -n open-match -f https://open-match.dev/install/v{{< param release_version >}}/yaml/05-jaeger-chart.yaml
    # Install the above telemetry backends with Open Match core services
    kubectl apply -n open-match -f https://open-match.dev/install/v{{< param release_version >}}/yaml/install.yaml
    # Install Stackdriver
    # No need to install, provided by GKE by default.
    ```

- Install via helm

    ```yaml
    $ helm install my-release --namespace open-match open-match/open-match \
    --set open-match-override.enabled=true \ # Install the default override configmap
    --set open-match-telemetry.enabled=true \ # Enable telemetry logic in Open Match core
    --set global.telemetry.jaeger.enabled # Install jaeger with Open Match core
    ```

## Enable telemetry exporters
{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
The configurations to enable/disable the telemetry exporters are not read at runtime. Please re-deploy Open Match if you want to change the telemetry settings. Also note that helm users can skip this section as overriding helm values change the default telemetry configs at the same time.
{{% /alert %}}

You can configure where and what telemetry you want to emit from your Open Match
deployment. To instrument Open Match with telemetry supports, modify your `06-open-match-override-configmap.yaml` to override the related settings. Please refer to [how to customize your Open Match deployment]({{< relref "../custom.md/#telemetry" >}}) for more details.

Below is an example of the data section in `om-configmap-override` configmap to enable all of the supported telemetry exporters:
```yaml
matchmaker_config_override.yaml:
  telemetry:
    zpages:
      enable: 'true'
    jaeger:
      enable: 'true'
    prometheus:
      enable: 'true'
    stackdriver:
      enable: 'true'
```

## Prometheus

Prometheus is the server for capturing and analyzing metrics. You can use it
to draft metric queries that can be used to debug a service in the moment or
tweak a query that can be used in a Grafana dashboard.

To access Prometheus you'll need to `kubectl port-forward` port 9090 from your
Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
# Port forward Prometheus to your machine, http://localhost:9090.
kubectl port-forward --namespace open-match service/open-match-prometheus-server 9090:9090
```

Next visit http://localhost:9090 in your browser.

Let's try an example query, `sum(rate(backend_tickets_assigned[5m]))`

This returns the number of tickets assigned by the backend server over a 5-minute sliding window period.

Let's break down each part of the query.

* `sum()` - This will take the sum over each individual rate produced by
   each server (there may be more than 1 backend server).
* `rate(metric_name[5m])` - Take the rate of a particular metric.
   Since a rate is not instantaneous we must use a sliding window where we take
   *metric_name[now]* - *metric_name[5m ago]* at every time point. The
   smaller the time window the more exact but choppy the data appears.

You can learn how to query your metrics from the
[Prometheus Query Basics](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/)
tutorial.

## Grafana Dashboard

The easiest way to view the health of your Open Match cluster is to browse
the Grafana dashboards. Open Match ships with a few dashboards to monitor RPC
traffic, database transaction rates, and database transaction time.

To access Grafana you'll need to `kubectl port-forward` port 3000 from your
Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
# Port forward Grafana to your machine, http://localhost:3000.
kubectl port-forward -n open-match service/open-match-grafana 3000:3000
```

Next visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser with
Username: `admin` Password: `openmatch`.

Once you're in the Home Dashboard try selecting gRPC. You'll see a page like
this:

## Jaeger

Jaeger is a distributed tracing tool. To view the Jaeger frontend, please run
```bash
# Port forward Jaeger frontend UI to your machine, http://localhost:16686.
kubectl port-forward -n open-match service/open-match-jaeger-query 16686:16686
```

Next visit http://localhost:16686 in your browser. You'll see a page like this:
