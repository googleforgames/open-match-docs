  Details of Open Match Backfill.

## Background

Some scenarios that could happen when playing multiplayer games include:

* A multiplayer game has a player(s) leave the game. To keep the game interesting and fun, matchmaking will replace the missing player with someone new.
* A large player count game (e.g.: battleroyal) will create a non-full match and allow players to connect to the game server prior to it being full. Players will wait in a lobby on the game server while new players are backfilled into the game until the server is fully populated.
* A social or world place in a game allows players to see others in the space, but other players are not strictly required. When players enter the game it is preferred to put players into an existing server, preventing players from joining low population servers. As existing servers reach capacity, the game server management service starts up new empty servers. The new empty servers request players to be backfilled into them, allowing more players to join world servers. Servers may be very long living, as new players replace the leaving players.
* A multiplayer game has a player(s), leave the game, and makes a request for new players to be backfilled into the game. One of the players in the game invites a friend to join using a social platform. The friend joins the game, and the game server cancels its backfill request.

## Main algorithm

1. Player creates Ticket (`T1`).
2. Director calls `Backend.FetchMatches` with a MatchProfile.
3. MMF runs `QueryBackfills` and `QueryTickets` using the MatchProfile. It returns `T1`.
4. MMF use `T1`, constructs a new Backfill (`B1`*) and returns a `Match` containing ticket `T1` and Backfill `B1`.
5. Director starts allocating GameServer with Backfill `B1` information.
6. Another player creates a Ticket (`T2`).
7. Director calls `Backend.FetchMatches`.
8. MMF runs `QueryBackfills` and `QueryTickets` using the MatchProfile. They return `B1` and `T2` accordingly.
9. MMF determines `B1` could be used because it has open slots available. `T2` and `B1` forms a new Match.
10. When GameServer allocating ends, it starts polling Open Match to acknowledge the backfill with `Backend.AcknowledgeBackfill` by ID received in the Match (`B1.ID`) and in order to assign the address of the GameServer for `T1` and `T2`.

*: The Backfill should be created with field `AllocateGameServer` set to `true`, so GameServer orchestrator (e.g.: [Agones](https://agones.dev/site/)) knows it has to create a new GameServer.

## Considerations

Since Backfill is a large feature, using it requires changes to many components inside Open Match.
If Backfill is not being used, no changes are required since the Backfill API doesn't change 
the behavior of the current Open Match API state.

### Acknowledging Backfills

To Acknowledge a Backfill is a request, that acts in form of a ping in an interval, made to Open Match Frontend to notify the associated tickets with their assignment.

GameServers would run AcknowledgeBackfill every N seconds, where N is, at most, 80% of the duration set for `pendingReleaseTimeout` (N < 0.8 * pendingReleaseTimeout).

### Cleaning up Backfills

This process, as its name suggests, deletes the Backfill objects from the state store that have a last acknowledge time bigger than the configured timeout duration.

Obs: you need to keep present if time for acknowledging a backfill expires, youâ€™ll need to recreate the Backfill object again.
