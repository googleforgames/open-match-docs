  Open Match is a *framework* for video game matchmaking.
---

Matchmaking begins when a player tells the game that they want to play. Every player has a set of attributes like skill, location, playtime, win-lose ratio, etc which may factor in how they are paired with other players. Typically, there's a trade off between the quality of the match vs the time to wait. Since Open Match is designed to scale with the player population, it should be possible to still have high quality matches while having high player count.
