## Overview

The Game Frontend serves as a layer that transfers players' matchmaking requests from players' Game Client to proto messages that Open Match can understand. The Game Frontend typically performs the following tasks:

- Fetches the player data from some backend storage (or Platform Services if required) and authenticates players.
- Submits the matchmaking requests to Open Match by creating a Ticket.
- Communicates the Assignment result back to the Game Client once Open Match found an Assignment for this Ticket.

This tutorial provides a very basic Game Frontend scaffold (`$TUTORIALROOT/frontend`) that periodically generates batches of fake Tickets, adds them to Open Match, and polls these Tickets for Assignment. Once an Assignment is received it emits a log with the Assignment details (as a proxy for returning the Assignment to the Player) and deletes the Ticket from Open Match.

Under production environment, polling each Ticket for Assignment is not recommended. We recommend using event handlers/listeners to communicate Assignments result to the Game Frontend.

## Make Changes

The Game Frontend uses a helper function `makeTicket()` in `$TUTORIALROOT/frontend/ticket.go` to generate a fake Ticket. Any property that is intended to be used for Matchmaking (for instance, game mode in this case) is set as a SearchField on the Ticket. For this tutorial, we create a Ticket that has a game mode specified as a Tag SearchField. The below code snippet picks a random game mode and sets it as a Tag on a fake Ticket.

```
func makeTicket() *pb.Ticket {
  modes := []string{"mode.demo", "mode.ctf", "mode.battleroyale"}
  ticket := &pb.Ticket{
    SearchFields: &pb.SearchFields{
      Tags: []string{
        modes[rand.Intn(len(modes))],
      },
    },
  }

  return ticket
}
```

Please copy the above helper or add your own fake Ticket creation logic to `$TUTORIALROOT/frontend/ticket.go`. Also, you may tweak the size of the Ticket creation batches, polling interval, etc. in `$TUTORIALROOT/frontend/main.go`.

### Configuring

The following values need to be changed if your setup is different from the default in the `$TUTORIALROOT/frontend/main.go`. The default value assumes you have Open Match deployed under `open-match` namespace and the Game Frontend under `mm101-tutorial` namespace in the same cluster:

> `omFrontendEndpoint` - Open Match Frontend endpoint

## Build and Push

Now that you have customized the Game Frontend, please run the below commands from `$TUTORIALROOT` to build a new image and push it to your configured image registry.

```
# Build the Frontend image.
docker build -t $REGISTRY/mm101-tutorial-frontend frontend/

# Push the Frontend image to the configured Registry.
docker push $REGISTRY/mm101-tutorial-frontend
```
